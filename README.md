# Working Practice
This will be our git working practice:

1. You delete your master branch.
2. For each issue, you do a pull from the core master, then branch that. The branch will be named as the number of the issue, plus a brief comment.  E.g.  **22 Map title**
3. You resolve the issue, then issue a PR.

# Installing and Building Practice

1. Install Node JS (*or nodejs-legacy on Ubuntu*)
2. Run ````npm install```` - to install dependencies
3. Run ````npm run build```` - to create the dist folder.

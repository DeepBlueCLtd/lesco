# Working Practice
This will be our git working practice:

1. You delete your master branch.
2. For each issue, you do a pull from the core master, then branch that. The branch will be named as the number of the issue, plus a brief comment.  E.g.  #22 Map title
3. You resolve the issue, then issue a PR.
